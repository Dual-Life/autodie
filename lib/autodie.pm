=head1 NAME

autodie - Replace functions with ones that succeed or die with lexical scope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use autodie;    # Recommended, implies 'use autodie qw(:all)'

    use autodie qw(open close);   # open/close succeed or die

    open(my $fh, "<", $filename); # No need to check! 

    {
        no autodie qw(open);          # open failures won't die
        open(my $fh, "<", $filename); # Could fail silently!
        no autodie;                   # disable all autodies
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

        bIlujDI' yIchegh()Qo'; yIHegh()!

        It is better to die() than to return() in failure.

                -- Klingon programming proverb.

B<NOTE!  This is BETA code.  It is NOT the final release.  Implementation
and interface may change!>

The C<autodie> pragma provides a convenient way to replace functions
that normally return false on failure with equivalents that throw
an exception on failure.

The C<autodie> pragma has I<lexical scope>, meaning that functions
and subroutines altered with C<autodie> will only change their behaviour
until the end of the enclosing block, file, or C<eval>.

If C<system> is specified as an argument to C<autodie>, then it
uses L<IPC::System::Simple> to do the heavy lifting.  See the
description of that module for more information.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

Exceptions produced by the C<autodie> pragma are members of the
L<autodie::exception> class.  The preferred way to work with
these exceptions is as follows:

    use feature qw(switch);

    eval {
        use autodie ':io';

        open(my $fh, '<', $some_file);

        my @records = <$fh>;

        close($fh);

    };

    given ($@) {
        when (undef)   { say "No error";                    }
        when ('open')  { say "Error from open";             }
        when (':io')   { say "Non-open, IO error.";         }
        when (':all')  { say "All other autodie errors."    }
        default        { say "Not an autodie error at all." }
    }

See L<autodie::exception> for further information on interrogating
exceptions.

=head1 GOTCHAS

Functions called in list context are assumed to have failed if they
return an empty list, or a list consisting only of a single undef
element.

=head1 BUGS

C<autodie> only works on Perl 5.10.  We'd like it to be able to
work on Perl 5.8.

Currently, autodying C<system> returns only a string, not a real
exception object.  This will change before the full release.

A bare autodie will change from meaning C<:all> to C<:default>
before the final release.
