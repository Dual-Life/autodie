	- Suggesting I look at namespace::clean as a pragma that
	  works under 5.8 and which is able to precisely delete
	  subroutines from globs.

Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek
	- Writing namespace::clean, which I twisted to my dark
	will to provide a faster, 5.8 clean autodie with less
	side-effects.

Stephen 'Stennie' Steneker
	- Spelling corrections.

Chocolateboy
	- Advice on $^H, %^H, and other dark and terrible magicks.
	- Being a wonderful sounding board for when I had too many
	  ideas and not enough implementation.

ikegami
	- Resolving the most frustrating issue of user-subroutine
	  replacement under Perl 5.8,
	- Enlightening me as to the correct way to reference globs.
	- Reminding me that 'use' really does happen first, regardless
	  of how it's been dressed.
