Fatal and autodie would not be possible if it were not for the contributions
of the wonderful people below.

Lionel Cons
        - Original module

Ilya Zakharevich
        - Prototype updates

Paul Fenwick
        - autodie, autodie::exception, Fatal overhaul

BrowserUk
        - Suggesting the name 'lethal', which the module was
          called during much of development.

Jured Waalboer
        - Suggesting the name 'autodie'

Aristotle Pagaltzis
        - Suggestions and sanity checking on design and interface

Mark Reed and Rolan Giersig
        - Klingon Translators

Matt Trout
	- Suggesting I look at namespace::clean as a pragma that
	  works under 5.8 and which is able to precisely delete
	  subroutines from globs.

Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek
	- Writing namespace::clean, which I twisted to my dark
	will to provide a faster, 5.8 clean autodie with less
	side-effects.

Stephen 'Stennie' Steneker
	- Spelling corrections.

Chocolateboy
	- Advice on $^H, %^H, and other dark and terrible magicks.
	- Being a wonderful sounding board for when I had too many
	  ideas and not enough implementation.

ikegami
	- Resolving the most frustrating issue of user-subroutine
	  replacement under Perl 5.8,
	- Enlightening me as to the correct way to reference globs.
	- Reminding me that 'use' really does happen first, regardless
	  of how it's been dressed.

Matt Kraai
        - Formatting fixess in diagnostics.

Darren Duncan
        - Spotting omissions in user documentation.

Damian Conway
        - Extremely detailed and inspirational input into how
          autodie::hints should work, as opposed to my original
          and rather stunted proposal.

Jacinta Richardson
        - Documentation, proof-reading, code review, and a huge
          amount of sound-boarding.  In particular most of the
          autodie::hints documentation would not exist without
          Jacinta's efforts.

Ben Morrow
        - Providing an excellent and compelling argument as to
          how roles should be handled.
        - Spotting that autodie can clobber package scalars when
          formats are copied between blogs.

Glenn Fowler
        - Documentation review and improvement when I had spent
          so long looking at the autodie::hints documentation I
          wasn't sure if they made sense anymore. ;)

Toby Corkindale
        - Documentation copyediting and improvements.
